# SQL Advanced Analytics Project

**Welcome to the SQL Advanced Analytics Project repository! üöÄ This project demonstrates comprehensive data analytics and reporting capabilities, from advanced SQL analysis to business intelligence insights.**

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Advanced SQL Analytics**: Implementing sophisticated analytical queries using window functions, CTEs, and complex aggregations.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends, cumulative metrics, and year-over-year comparisons.
3. **Performance Analysis**: Comparing current performance against historical data and targets.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on spending behavior and lifecycle stages.
5. **Business Intelligence Reports**: Creating comprehensive customer and product reports for stakeholder insights.
